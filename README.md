# Brain_Stroke
Machine Learning project on Brain Stroke
in this project we are predicting whether the patient is having Brain Stroke or not
in the brain stroke 01.ipynb file i use Logistic regression, KNN,SVM,Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm to implement a predicting model
in the Brain_Stroke.py file i use streamlit python library to impliment one of those model in a web-app to demonstrate the model
